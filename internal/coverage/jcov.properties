# is copying the coverage file generated by running the tests under samples/ejb,
# The coverage result file for the app server will be copied to the result
# directory as samples-ejb-sjsas.coverage.  Set to false to generate a result

# The list of coverage files generated on a per VM basis including
# an optional port number if using a JCOV grabber.  Even when using
# a coverage file to capture a VMs coverage numbers a port should
# be supplied to work around a bug in JCOV that starts a grabber
# listener on the default port of 3330 even when using a coverage
# file to capture results.  The coverage filename is optional is using
# a grabber to capture coverage results.  The port number should also be
# optional when using a grabber but due to the bug described above,
# coverage files should include a dummy port to avoid the JCOV bug.
