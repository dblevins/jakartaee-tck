        The WSDL binding of Web Services Addressing introduces the following element and attribute information items for referencing WSDL metadata from an EPR's metadata section.  These element information items are used in an EPR's metadata section.

        For backwards compatibility, 1.1 definitions can be embedded in the metadata section of an EPR to provide a consuming application with WSDL information that applies to the referenced endpoint.

                 To do so, the creator of an EPR MAY include a WSDL 1.1 definitions element in the metadata property of the EPR. The semantics of the embedded WSDL is as defined by the WSDL 1.1 specification.

            <description>
             In particular, embedding a WSDL service component description MAY be used by EPR issuers to indicate the presence of alternative addresses and protocol bindings to access the referenced endpoint.  In the case of WSDL 1.1, additional ports can be conveyed by the WSDL 1.1 service definition.

            <description>
              If the ServiceName element appears in the EPRs [metadata] and an embedded WSDL service component is also provided inside a descriptions or definitions component, then the ServiceName SHOULD match the name of (one or more of) the WSDL service(s) included therein; the endpoint (port) name SHOULD match as well if present.
