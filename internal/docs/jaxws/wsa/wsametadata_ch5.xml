        WSDL 1.1 Message Exchange Patterns - One-way

This section describes which of the core message properties are mandatory for messages in the various MEPs defined by WSDL 1.1.

This is a straightforward one-way message. No responses are expected but related messages could be sent as part of other message exchanges.
Table 5-1. Message addressing properties for one way message. 
<br/>
Property &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mandatory &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Description
[destination] 	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Y &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Provides the address of the intended receiver of this message
[action] 	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Y &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Identifies the semantics implied by this message

        WSDL 1.1 Message Exchange Patterns - Request-Response

This section describes which of the core message properties are mandatory for messages in the various MEPs defined by WSDL 1.1.
 
This is request-response. A reply is expected hence mandating [reply endpoint] in the request message. The response message might be a fault.
<br/>
Table 5-2. Message addressing properties for request message. <br/>
Property &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Mandatory &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Description
[destination]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 	Y  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Provides the address of the intended receiver of this message
[action] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Y &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Identifies the semantics implied by this message
[reply endpoint] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Y &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Intended receiver for the reply to this message.
[message id] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Y &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Unique identifier for this message. Used in the [relationship] property of the reply message.

    <br/>
Table 5-3. Message addressing properties for response message. 
<br/>
Property 	Mandatory 	Description
[destination] 	Y 	Provides the address of the intended receiver of this message
[action] 	Y 	Identifies the semantics implied by this message
[relationship] 	Y 	Indicates that this message is a reply to the request message using the request message [message id] value and the predefined http://www.w3.org/2005/08/addressing/reply IRI.

        WSDL 1.1 Message Exchange Patterns - Notification

This section describes which of the core message properties are mandatory for messages in the various MEPs defined by WSDL 1.1.
 
From the WS-Addressing perspective this MEP is the same as One-way. The properties defined in 5.1.1 One-way apply to this MEP also.
