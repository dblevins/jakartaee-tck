<h2>Compatibility Test Plan for Connector 1.6 TCK</h2>
<div STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><font size=-1>Paul Hendley </font></div>

<div STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><font size=-1>last updated&nbsp; 08/25/2008</font></div>

<p><br>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<div STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This test plan documents the Connector
1.6 high level Compatiblity test plan for the Connector 1.6 specification.
  Compatibility test cases are derived from the requirements of the engineering
specifications. The reference implementation will validate that the specifications
can be implemented, will provide a reference point for the development
community, and will be used for developing Compatibility Tests.  </div>

<p><br>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Provide Connector 1.6 compatibility tests
for Connector version 1.6. This will include writing tests for system level
contracts which will need to work within one of the following user environments:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     - testing between a Java EE 6 Application Server and a resource adapter
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     - testing between a Java EE 6 based Web Profile and a resource adapter
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     - testing within a standalone environment (ie non-app server, non-web-profile)
<p>

It is worth noting that the customer may have any one of the above test environments
and the Connector TCK will need to operate within their test environment - regardless
of which environment they have, though the actual number of tests may vary based on 
the environment the customer runs within.  As an example of why the number of tests 
may vary, we can see that any EJB related connector tests should work in a Java EE 6
environment but we cannot be guaranteed there will be an EJB container if the 
customer is running within a standalone environment.  So in the latter case, we will
need to support a way for the customer to specify the environment they are running
within.  (Alternatively, the use of keyword arguements at runtime may be used to 
allow specifying which test environment to run in  (eg Java EE 6, Web Profile, or standalone).
Additionally, any EJB related test will require support of .ear files - which is not
guarranteed in a non-JavaEE environment.

<p>
The goal is to test Connector 1.6 contracts for the following areas: 

<ul>
<li STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">
Work management contract: This allows a resource adapter to submit Work
instances to be executed by an application server    (or comparable container???).</li>

<li STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">
Life cycle management contract: This allows the runtime and deployment
behaviour of the resource adapter into application server    (or comparable container???).</li>

<li STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">
Message Inflow: This provides a mechanism for EIS to the use resource adapter
to dispatch calls to MDB    (or comparable messaging service???).</li>

<li STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">
Transaction Inflow : This provides a contract to import external transaction
into the application server     (or comparable container???).</li>
</ul>


<p><br>
<h2>Non-Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Performance</li>

<li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scalability</li>

<li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ease of use</li>

<li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-required areas of
the specification.</li>

<li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The capability to certify
any Resource Adapter Connector 1.6 specification.</li>
</ul>


<p><br>
<h2>Types of Compatibility Tests</h2>
<div STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There are 3 types of tests that make up
the Compatibility Test Suite, these include:</div>

<ul>
<li STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">
Signature Tests - Checks that all of the required API signatures are available
for an implementation, no supersets or subsets.</li>

<li STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">
API Tests - Verifies that all of the required classes and methods behave
according to the specification on a method by method basis.</li>

<li STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">
End to End Tests - These will allow the testing of life cycles, state transitions, and general behaviour.</li>
</ul>


<p><br>
<h2>Targated High Level Areas</h2>
<p>
The following areas have been identified as requirements of the Connector 
specification and are targeted for TCK test development.
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
The Connector defined SPI for the Life Cycle contracts. 
</li>

<li>
&nbsp;The Connector defined SPI for the Work Management contracts. 
</li>

<li>
The Connector defined SPI for the Transaction Inflow contracts. 
</li>

<li>
The Connector defined SPI for the Message Inflow contracts. 
</li>

<li>
The Connector defined SPI for the Packaging and Deployment contracts.
</li>
</ul>

<p><br>
<h2>Non-Targeted High Level Areas</h2>
<ul>
<li>
&nbsp;The Connector 1.6 specification recommends, but does not require,
that a resource adapter support CCI.&nbsp; 
The Connector 1.6 TCK will not contain any tests for the CCI.
</li>
<b><font size=+1>QUESTION:  will this change in 1.6???</font></b>

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
&nbsp;The Connector 1.6 TCK tests will not be written for any resource adapter.&nbsp;
A specific, known (ie home-grown) Resource Adapter (described later in this document) will
be deployed on a licensees 'server' in order to test the licensee's
Connector implementation.&nbsp; A TCK for Resource Adapters is beyond the scope 
of this specification.</li>
<b><font size=+1>QUESTION:  What constitutes the licensees 'server' for the case of a Connector 1.6 standalone mode???</font></b>
<p>
<b><font size=+1>QUESTION:  Can we rely on being able to deploy a Resource Adapter to a licensee when they are in standalone mode?</font></b>
</ul>

<p><br>
<h2>Test Approach</h2>
<p>The purpose of the Connector TCK is to insure that a licensee's Connector implementation
has fullfiled all the Connector 1.6 specification which allows any
Connector 1.6 resource adapter to be deployed and function correctly.
<p>
<b><font size=+1>QUESTION:  This was the case for 1.5 - is this still true for 1.6 given new standalone support???</font></b>

<p>It will be necessary to have a resource adapter which fullfils the Connector
1.6 specification to be deployed on a licensee's server. Previouly, for Connector
1.5, three tck specific resource adapters were built which used home-grown EIS for 
transaction support and on that, assertions were built for the following areas
<br>&nbsp;


<ul>
<li> Life Cycle Contract: The following areas will be coverd</li>
<ul><ul>
<li> ResourceAdapter runtime behavior</li>
<li> ResourceAdapter association with ManagedConnectionFactory and ActivationSpec</li>
</ul></ul></ul>

<ul>
<li> WorkManager Contract: The following areas will be coverd</li>
<ul><ul>
<li> To ensure that WorkManager is correctly implemented by Application server (or comparitive container???)</li>
<li> Work Object from resource adapter can be passed to WorkManager.</li>
</ul></ul></ul>

<ul>
<li> Transaction Inflow contract:&nbsp; The following areas will be covered</li>
<ul><ul>
<li> Message delivery is transacted or not.</li>
<li> XAResource being used by the Transaction Manager.</li>
</ul></ul></ul>

<ul>
<li> Message Inflow Contract:</li>
<ul><ul>
<li> Messages can be dispactched to an non transaction requried MDB.</li>
<li> Messages can be dispactched to an transaction requried MDB.</li>
</ul></ul></ul>

<ul>
<li> Deployment Tests.</li>
<ul><ul>
<li> Embeded resource adapter can be deployed correctly and can be used by the application it is deployed with.</li>
</ul></ul></ul>

<p>
The test approach for Connector 1.6 will remain similar to Connector 1.5.  
However, since spec requirements are changing and there is no longer a guarantee that there 
will be an app server (and maybe not even a web server for the case of standalone env) , it will 
be necessary for the licensee to implement multiple porting packages.  Additionally, there
may be some tests that will not be applicable to a licensee's given environment (eg no ejb
container is guaranteed so any MDB tests would only apply if the licensee's implementation 
were to include an ejb container.)
<p>
Finally, the test strategies will evolve as discussions with the CTS team, RI team, and the Connector 1.6 spec progress.


<p><br>
<h2>Deliverables</h2>
<p>&nbsp;TS resource adapters (Bi-directional) and has all 3 flavours (XA,
Local, No Transaction), which will be part of the TCK.
<br>&nbsp;A TS EIS which is used by resource adapters. (Brief Description
of TSeis)
<br>&nbsp;A set of tests for the Connector 1.6 Compatibility Test Suite.
<br>&nbsp;An updated Connector User's Guide for setup and configuration specific
details for the Connector 1.6&nbsp; tests.
<br>&nbsp;A set of Porting Packages for supporting the Connector 1.6 TCK in one of the three possible licensee environments of: Java EE 6, Web Profile (ie a sub profile of Java EE 6), or a standalone mode.
<p>NOTE:  the Connector TCk will be made available in one of two ways:  (1)  as part of the entire CTS test suite (which assumes the presence of the JavaEE or a subset of JavaEE such as the Web Profile) or (2) standalone TCK which assumes NO JavaEE/Web Profile.
