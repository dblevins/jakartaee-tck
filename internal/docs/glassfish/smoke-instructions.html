<ul>
         <li>Download the latest CTS 7 smoke test bundle from the nightly
subset bundles link on the CTS 7 page.  The bundle is named javaee-smoke.zip:
    <a href="http://invalid.domain.com/JWSCQE/tcks/cts/7.0/index.html">http://invalid.domain.com/JWSCQE/tcks/cts/7.0/index.html</a>
 PLEASE NOTE:  No Configuration &amp; Porting bundle is necessary.</li>
         <li>    unzip the bundle smoke test bundle</li>
         <li>    set TS_HOME to the &lt;unzip-path&gt;/javaee-smoke</li>
         <li>    set JAVA_HOME to an appropriate Java SE installation (Version
6 or higher) </li>
         <li>    set ANT_HOME to point to an appropriate Apache Ant and set ANT_HOME/bin to PATH variable</li>
         <li>    If you are using a Mac, you must set ANT_OPTS to -Dderby.storage.fileSyncTransactionLog=true</li>
         <li>edit your $TS_HOME/bin/ts.jte file.  If you are using the standard
        default Glassfish V4 settings then you simply need to configure these properties:</li>

</ul>

<ol>

  <ul>
           <li>         javaee.home // the base directory of your Glassfish V4
installation</li>
           <li>         javaee.home.ri // for the purposes of the smoke tests,
 please set this to the same value as javaee.home</li>
           <li>         orb.host  // the name of the machine running the
Glassfish V3 server</li>
          <li>         mailHost  // the name of an accessible SMTP server</li>
          <li>         mailuser1 // a valid email address</li>
  </ul>

</ol>



<ul>
         <li>cd $TS_HOME/bin/xml</li>
         <li>run "ant -f smoke.xml smoke"<br>
 </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>Note:  the execution of this target will generate a log file, named
smoke.log, that contains the test results as well as any data written to std out
and std err.  The log will be created in the directory where you invoke the smoke
target.  So if you run the smoke target in $TS_HOME/bin/xml, the log
file will be there.  The smoke target automatically configures CTS and the appserver,
enables JACC, starts the Derby database inits it with the appropriate tables
(a configuration  log file is generated $TS_HOME/bin/config_vi.log). When the tests
have finished running, Derby is stopped, JACC is disabled, CTS and the appserver
are unconfigured.<br>
